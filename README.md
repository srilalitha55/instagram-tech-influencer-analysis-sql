## Question 02 – What are the highest and lowest recorded impressions for each post type? 

### SQL Query

``` SELECT
  post_type,
  MAX(impressions) AS highest_impressions,
  MIN(impressions) AS lowest_impressions
FROM gdb0120.fact_content
GROUP BY post_type
ORDER BY post_type;
```
### Output

## Question 03 – Filter all the posts that were published on a weekend in the month of March and April and export them to a separate csv file.

### SQL Query

``` SELECT fc.*
FROM gdb0120.fact_content fc 
JOIN gdb0120.dim_dates dd ON dd.date = fc.date 
WHERE dd.weekday_or_weekend = 'Weekend' 
AND dd.month_name IN ('March', 'April') 
ORDER BY fc.date, fc.post_type;

SELECT fc.*
FROM gdb0120.fact_content fc 
JOIN gdb0120.dim_dates dd ON dd.date = fc.date 
WHERE dd.weekday_or_weekend = 'Weekend' 
AND dd.month_name IN ('March', 'April')
INTO OUTFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/weekend_posts_mar_apr.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
 LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```
### Output

### SQL Query

``` SELECT
  dd.month_name,
  SUM(fa.profile_visits) AS total_profile_visits,
  SUM(fa.new_followers)  AS total_new_followers
FROM gdb0120.fact_account fa
JOIN gdb0120.dim_dates dd
  ON dd.date = fa.date
GROUP BY dd.month_name
ORDER BY MIN(dd.date);
```
